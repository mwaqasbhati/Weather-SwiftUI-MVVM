# Weather-SwiftUI-MVVM

This application fetches weather forecast from openweathermap API and displays data. I includes feature like showing 5 days and 3 hours weather forecast data of the current location. you can search current weather of minimum 3 and maximum 7 cities at a time. 

## Demonstrations

## Frameworks/Tools used:

* SwiftUI
* MVVM 
* Combine Framework
* Clubbing multiple network requests using Combine `mergeAll` feature.
* XCTest Framework 

## Discussions

I have used `SwiftUI` for user interface creation, `Combine framework` allows me to use features like Observable, states, publishers and subscribers. `MVVM` design pattern helped me to use features like less code, more decoupling, modular approach, easy to test, Bindings make UI updates easier to handle, ease of maintainability etc.
